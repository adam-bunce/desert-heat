## Limitations
The plugin depends on a list of items to calculate how quickly your water will drain, 
this list is not 100% accurate. Because of this you should take the calculated times with a grain of salt,
unless confirmed through your own use of the plugin.

## Support
If you're having to use the Manual Offset 
config option then some equipment is missing/has been added incorrectly. 
To fix this *(or to address any other issues)* create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/adam-bunce/desert-heat/issues) 
with a picture of your `Equipment` and the `offset helper chat messages`, or fill out [This Google Form](https://forms.gle/Y5YvxJsys2FuG6vW9) and I will fix it ASAP.
